      "question": "Q1. What will be the average time complexity of the Bellman-ford algorithm if the time taken to realx an edge is O(log V)?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "O(V log V)",
        "b": "O(V log E)",
        "c": "O(V log V + E log V)",
        "d": "O(VE log V)"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "d": "The time complexity of Bellman-Ford algorithm is O(VE). Now the time taken to relax an edge is O(log V). So, the time complexity of the above described Bellman-Ford algorithm will be O(VE log V)."

        "a": "True",

      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Instead of running the algorithm for |V|-1 times, we can run it for |V| times. If the shortest distance of any vertex changes in the |V|th iteration, then it means that there is a negative weight cycle in the graph."

      "explanations": {
        "d": "The maximum number of edges between node 0 and v will never exceed |v| - 1. Hence the cost of the longest shortest path will never exceed 2(|v| - 1)."
